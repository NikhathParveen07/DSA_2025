You are given an array arr of positive integers. 
Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. 
An element is considered a leader if it is greater than to all elements to its right. 
The rightmost element is always a leader.

Examples:
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.
Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1]
Output: [10, 1]

CODE:
vector<int> leaders(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Code here
        vector<int> ans;
        int n = arr.size();
        int curr_el = arr[n-1];
        ans.push_back(curr_el);
        for(int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(arr[i] > curr_el){
                curr_el = arr[i];
                ans.push_back(curr_el);
            }
        }
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
