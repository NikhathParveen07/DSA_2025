My Journal of 100 Days of Coding ‚Äì DSA

üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
I‚Äôm an aspiring software developer who dreams big, but often battles with fear of failure.
That fear sometimes turns into procrastination. Still, I always come back ‚Äî because my desire to master things from the ground up is stronger than my doubt.
‚ú® This journey is a reminder that progression matters more than perfection.
I am using Strivers A2Z sheet and platforms like Geeks for Geeks, leetcode, and codestudio.

üìú A Note to My Future Self
Dear Future Me,
If you ever feel like you didn‚Äôt do enough ‚Äî or if self-doubt starts to creep in ‚Äî come back here.
This is your trace. The effort. The consistency. The courage to begin, even if late.
You showed up. You learned.
You started. And that matters.
