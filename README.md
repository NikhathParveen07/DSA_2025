My Journal of 100 Days of Coding – DSA

👩‍💻 About Me
I’m an aspiring software developer who dreams big, but often battles with fear of failure.
That fear sometimes turns into procrastination. Still, I always come back — because my desire to master things from the ground up is stronger than my doubt.
✨ This journey is a reminder that progression matters more than perfection.
I am using Strivers A2Z sheet and platforms like Geeks for Geeks, leetcode, and codestudio.

📜 A Note to My Future Self
Dear Future Me,
If you ever feel like you didn’t do enough — or if self-doubt starts to creep in — come back here.
This is your trace. The effort. The consistency. The courage to begin, even if late.
You showed up. You learned.
You started. And that matters.
